To connect a component to the store as a listener you have to
create a mapStateToProps function to get import the global state
to the props within the component.

Here you define the name you want to give the prop and return the
reducer from the state.

Eventually you import Connect:
// import { connect } from "react-redux";

Here you add mapStateToProps and if you want to perform an action
you can define it here with the actionName and followed by the
name you want to give the action inside the component. 

!! Don't forget to import the actions !!

!! You use this to address the action inside the component !!


// const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
//     return {
//         variable: state.reducer_name
//     }
// }

// export default connect(mapStateToProps, {actionName: name_you_want_to_give_to_action})(componentName);
